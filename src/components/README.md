2 types of composite and 1 type of leaf.

first composite is for groups - example, a composite that holds 'decision' type and its children

second composite is hidden (meaning it has no visible representation, only conceptual), it is used to wrap a leaf and
convert to composite(2nd type composite) when we need cross axis group(2nd type of composite) inside the first composite group.

second type of composite holds, sibling (not children).

only 'decision' or ... (first type of composite) can have childrens.

in hindsight, second type of composite can only reside inside the first type of composite.
or its a leaf which cannot exist in itself
